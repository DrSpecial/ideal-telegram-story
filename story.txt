The weather today is cloudy. It was supposed to be very sunny and hot out for our soccer match today, so the clouds have added a bit of gloom to our team's mood. We've won every game of the season so far and we're trying to get to the state tournament. However, our best player, Tommy, broke his ankle yesterday!
