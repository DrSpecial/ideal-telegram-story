The weather today is cloudy. It was supposed to be very sunny and hot out for our soccer match today, so the clouds have added a bit of gloom to our team's mood. We've won every game of the season so far and we're trying to get to the state tournament. However, our best player, Tommy, broke his ankle yesterday! Knowing this, I had to step up. My coach put me in the game and I began to try harder than I ever did. Thankfully, my team did the same and we ended up winning the game which qualified us for the state tournament.
